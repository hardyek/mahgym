Turn Process

1. 14 Tile Player Discards
2. Calculate all possible Pong/Kong/Chow/Hu
    - If Hu is possible end game (an agent has won)
3. Iterate over each agent that can make a move in order of priority and ask them if they want to make that action or not.
    1. If so then process that action (that agent will end up with 14 tiles)
    2. If not then move play counter clockwise and draw from deck (agent ends up with 14 tiles)
4. Repeat
