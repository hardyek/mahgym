Turn Process

1. 14 Tile Player Discards
2. Calculate all possible Pong/Kong/Chow/Hu
    - If Hu is possible end game (an agent has won)
3. Iterate over each agent that can make a move in order of priority and ask them if they want to make that action or not.
    1. If so then process that action (that agent will end up with 14 tiles)
    2. If not then move play counter clockwise and draw from deck (agent ends up with 14 tiles)
4. Repeat

Achieved by:

To check a win we need to check if there is a set of concealed_melds (sets of 3) and exposed_melds (sets of 3/4) that make up 12 tiles and the two remaining tiles in the hand make a pair

there should be a function that operates on a players hand "makes_new_meld(tile)" that checks if a tile makes a new meld (Bool) this can be done to check which moves are possible.
